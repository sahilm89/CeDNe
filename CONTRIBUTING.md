# Contributing to CeDNe

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CeDNe! We welcome contributions that improve the functionality, usability, and biological insight of this framework.

This document outlines guidelines and expectations for contributing to the project, during its pre-publication phase and eventually.

## Status of the Project

**CeDNe is currently under active development, and the core modeling framework is unpublished.** Please note:

- The `main` and `dev` branches reflect the current scientific direction of an upcoming paper.
- The `dev-contrib` branch is available for community tools and enhancements that are not part of the core framework.

---

## What You Can Contribute

We currently welcome:

- Utility tools
- Visualizations and plotting enhancements
- Tests and documentation improvements
- Benchmarking tools
- Compatibility wrappers for other neuroscience datasets or formats

## Contribution Policy

To preserve the integrity of our ongoing work:

- Contributions that modify or expose the **core modeling logic**, **simulation engine**, or **optimization pipeline** may be deferred until after publication.
- All external contributions will be merged into a **contributor branch (`dev-contrib`)** unless otherwise approved.
- By submitting a PR, you agree that:
  - You are offering your code under the project's license (MIT).
  - You do not claim ownership of the unpublished components of the CeDNe framework.
  - Inclusion in future publications (e.g., authorship, acknowledgments) will be discussed transparently and in good faith based on the nature of the contribution.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and work on your own branch.
2. **Open an issue** or discussion before starting large contributions.
3. **Make a pull request** targeting the `dev-contrib` branch.
4. Follow code style and add meaningful docstrings.
5. Include simple test scripts or notebooks when relevant.

## Recognition

We deeply appreciate contributions and are committed to appropriate credit:
- Significant contributors will be listed in the README.
- Tools used in scientific publications will be cited or acknowledged.
- Authors of major modules may be invited as co-authors in follow-up software-focused papers.
