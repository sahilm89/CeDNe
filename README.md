# CeDNe: *C. elegans* Dynamical Network

CeDNe (pronounced Sid-nee) is a Python Library for multi-omic integration of neuroscience data. CeDNe is built on top of **networkx** in order to leverage its graph structure
and Python's object oriented capabilities together to create graph-based data containers that are
intuitive to store and manage neuroscience data for analysis and modeling. Due to this structure, CeDNe acts as a multi-omic tool to integrate different sources of information together and facilitates contextualizing new data using existing information about *C. elegans*. In order to facilitate usage, CeDNe
also comes with several utility functions that make common tasks very easy to execute. For advanced usage,
users can access CeDNE objects directly.

CeDNe is easy to use with only a bit of programming experience and several examples have been provided to 
demonstrate its use. CeDNe can also easily integrate into existing Python based analyses pipelines.
